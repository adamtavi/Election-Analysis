# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:
Purpose of this election audit analysis is to see if we can create a faster and automated way to decipher election results for US Congressional precinct in Colorado. We will utilize python code to analyze and decipher who won based on popular vote. Once we are successful in creating code to show who won, we will then use this code to audit other congressional and senatorial elections moving forward. 

# Election-Audit Results:
## How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- 369,711 votes were cast
## Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- County Votes:
-	Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
-	Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
-	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
## Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Denver (306,055)
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
## Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
- Diana DeGette won the election with 73.8% of the total votes
- Winner: Diana DeGette
- Winning Vote Count: 272,892
- Winning Percentage: 73.8%

# Election-Audit Summary:
Good evening, Election Commission.

After thorough analysis we have created a Python coding script that audits the election results for US Congressional precinct in Colorado. We were able to automate the process through code and rerun that code for the next election in Colorado.

We also believe that this script can be modified to be used for other elections as well. For instance: if we need to modify the script to only analyze voting turnout in one county we can. We would remove our county if statement and proceed to analyze that one county. Another instance: if you just want to see the total voting count and not the percentage of votes by candidate we can modify the script by removing the vote percentage formula in our script.

We strongly believe that this coding script can be used to automate auditing elections in the future.
